# Advent of Code - 2020

Solutions in Python to the Advent of Code challenges for the year of 2020.

I will attempt to log each of my solutions and explain my logic behind each one as I go along, but I have fallen behind with this part and as such I will try to fill them out in my free time as I go along. Some of the solutions won't be pretty, but due to no space or time complexity restrictions and a personal vendetta to beat a few of my lecturers on a private university leaderboard, they are the best that I can do. I may go back and attempt to flesh some of them out a bit further down the line but I'll see how much free time I get!
